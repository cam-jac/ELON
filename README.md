# ELON
A multi-month 3-man high school capstone project, utilizing Unity3D & C# to create a full top-down 2D shooter, complete with handmade art assets and sound.
# Opening the Files
Due to the...er...unfortunate size of the files, they've all been individually 'rared and placed here. In order to open them as a Unity Project, you simply extract the contained files into folders of the same name. You don't need the screenshot folder, though, that's for the readme.
